The main security features implemented in this project:

1. Password Hashing: User passwords are hashed using bcrypt via passlib before being stored in the database. Password verification is also handled securely.

2. JWT Authentication: The backend uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. Tokens are created and verified using the jose library, and include expiration times.

3. OAuth2 Bearer Tokens: FastAPI's OAuth2PasswordBearer is used for securing endpoints, requiring a valid bearer token for access.

4. Role-Based Access Control: There are checks for user roles (admin, driver, goods_owner, superadmin, etc.) to restrict access to certain endpoints and actions.

5. CORS Middleware: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to control which origins can access the backend API, helping to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

6. Session and Permission Checks: Endpoints verify that the current user is authorized to perform actions (e.g., only allowing users to change their own password, or only admins to access admin routes).

7. Sensitive Data in Environment Variables: Secrets like the JWT secret key and email credentials are loaded from environment variables, not hardcoded.

8. Email Verification: There are endpoints for sending and verifying email-based OTPs, which can be used for account verification or password reset.

These features collectively provide authentication, authorization, secure password storage, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
